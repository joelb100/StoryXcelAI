Replit Developer Request Prompt (Explanation Template)

    Purpose

    I am building a web app called StoryXcel, a modular AI-driven storytelling and production tool. Below are key notes about the current layout, how it's supposed to function, and what is incorrect in the current implementation vs. the intended design.

    Please review the design intent, then help me implement/fix the layout as described.

    Pic #1 ‚Äì Current layout in Replit preview

        This is what I'm currently seeing in my live preview inside Replit.

    Pic #2 ‚Äì Intended layout and spacing background

        This image shows the correct layout structure and proportions I want across the screen.

    Pic #3 ‚Äì Correct button/icon placement overlay

        This image shows the proper positioning of all Builder tabs, sidebars, chat box, etc.

    Pic #4 ‚Äì Correct logo file (transparent)

        Please use this as the logo in the top-left header instead of any placeholder. The X is custom styled and part of the identity.

‚ùì Questions I Need Answered to Proceed

    Scaling/Layout

        How do I lock the spacing and proportions of the left sidebar, top Builder bar, and chat input area to match pic 2 and 3?

        Should I use CSS grid, flexbox, or absolute positioning to ensure the Builder tab bar doesn't shift or collapse?

    Sidebar Functionality

        What's the best way to dynamically show/hide the right and left sidebars depending on the active page/tab?

        Can I define the functionality of each right sidebar icon later without breaking layout logic?

    Builder Tab Navigation

        Can we highlight tabs and change the center white panel without refreshing the entire layout?

        Should I use React Router, or should this be built as a SPA with conditional rendering?

    Persistent AI Chat Box

        How do I make the chat box stay fixed at the bottom, regardless of the page scroll or content height?

        Should I use a component hook or absolute positioning with z-index for this?

    Visual Styling / Font / Icons

        What is the best way to lock the UI color scheme across pages? Should I create a shared style sheet or use Tailwind classes?

        Can I preload and map the icons used in pic 3 to functional buttons even if the logic isn‚Äôt hooked up yet?
