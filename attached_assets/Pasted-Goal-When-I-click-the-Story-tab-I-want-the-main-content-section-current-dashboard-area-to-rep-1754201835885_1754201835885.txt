Goal:

When I click the “Story” tab, I want the main content section (current dashboard area) to replace with a Story Editor Layout that looks like the provided reference (Pic 3). The AI Story Assistant panel should remain static across all tabs.
Breakdown of Changes Needed:
1. Layout Behavior:

    The global navbars (top tabs, sidebars, AI Assistant footer panel) must remain unchanged and static.

    Only the main content section (current dashboard area) should swap views when clicking the “Story” tab.

    The Story tab should switch to a Story Editor Layout (Pic 3) where:

        The left side (green box) has input fields for Project Name, Genre, Sub-Genre, Theme, Sub Theme, Central Conflict, Plot A, Subplot B, Subplot C, Plot Twists, Emotional Hook.

        The right side (red box) becomes a large text area input (plain textarea is fine for now).

        The breadcrumbs/header text at the top should change from “Dashboard” to “Story Builder”.

2. Functionality Flow:

    When the user clicks the Story Tab:

        Replace the current Dashboard main content section with the Story Builder layout.

        The left sidebar inputs (green area) should become editable fields.

        The right content area (red area) should be a text editor (plain textarea).

        Breadcrumb should update to “Story Builder”.

    All other tabs (Dashboard, Production, etc.) should retain the existing layout.

    The AI Story Assistant (bottom panel) should always remain visible across all tabs.

3. Component Details:

    You can create a new component/page for Story Builder View (e.g., <StoryBuilder />).

    You can hardcode the input fields layout on the left (no need for dynamic forms yet).

    The textarea editor on the right can be a simple HTML <textarea> with basic styling to match the reference.

4. Implementation Notes:

    I am not sure if the routing is handled via Wouter’s <Route> system or manual state toggling.

        If using Wouter, configure a new /story route for the Story tab that swaps in <StoryBuilder />.

        If not using Wouter, you can implement a simple state-based conditional render when clicking “Story”.

    All layout/grid measurements should mirror the reference image provided (Pic 3) in terms of spacing, width proportions, and alignment.

Summary:

    Clicking “Story” Tab swaps the main content area with the Story Builder layout.

    Sidebars and AI Assistant remain static.

    Left input fields + right textarea for writing.

    Breadcrumb updates to "Story Builder".

    Wouter routing preferred if setup, otherwise a simple state toggle for now.
