ðŸ§± Grid System:

    The layout is based on a 28-column grid with consistent gutter spacing.

    Each vertical guide represents a column division.

    The full layout spans columns 1â€“28, which will be used to proportionally define content placement.

ðŸ”§ Additional Notes:

    Gutters between columns are uniform.

    All sections follow a modular box layout, easy to implement with Tailwind grid-cols-28 or flex + width ratios.

    You may use Tailwindâ€™s col-span-* classes for precise column control.

    Suggested breakpoint: Collapse left/right sidebars on sm screens and stack main, friends, and project areas vertically.

    For precision: Use Tailwindâ€™s grid, col-span, row-span, gap-*, and px-* classes to space items correctly.
